# DOM Manipulation 

### Project Description

The goal of this assignment is to create a user-friendly Expense Tracker App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should allow users to add and delete expenses, display them in a tabular format, and categorize expenses. Additionally, data persistence should be implemented using Local Storage to ensure the expense data is retained even after the page is refreshed.

### Requirements:

1. User Interface (UI): 
Design and implement an intuitive and visually appealing UI for the Expense Tracker App. The UI should consist of the following components:

- Input fields for entering the expense name, amount, and date.
- A drop-down menu to select the expense category.
- A button to add the expense to the tracker.
- A table to display the list of expenses, showing the name, amount, date, and category of each expense.
- Total expense amount display.
- Delete buttons for each expense entry to remove them from the tracker.

2. Expense Addition and Deletion: When the user enters the expense details and clicks the "Add Expense" button, the app should add the expense to the table, update the total expense amount accordingly, and save the data to Local Storage. The user should also be able to delete expenses by clicking the corresponding delete button.

3. Data Persistence: Implement data persistence using Local Storage to store the expense data. Upon loading the app, it should check if any saved data exists in Local Storage and populate the table with the saved expenses.

4. Advanced DOM Manipulation: Utilize advanced DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically update the UI when an expense is added or deleted. Ensure that the total expense amount and the expense table are updated in real-time.

5. Number and Date Handling: Utilize JavaScript's number and date objects to handle numeric calculations, format the expense date in a user-friendly manner, and display it in the table.

6. Expense Categorization: Implement a feature to allow users to categorize their expenses. The drop-down menu for selecting the category should be populated dynamically based on the available categories. Expenses should be displayed according to their respective categories in the table.

### Submission

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your cloned project repository.

3. Check the current status of your repository by running the following command:
   </br>
   `git status`

4. Add any modified or new files to the staging area by executing the following command:
   </br>
   `git add .`
   </br>
   This will stage all the changes in your project directory for the commit.

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message using the following command:
   </br>
   `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

6. Push your code to the remote repository using the following command:
   </br>
   `git push origin main`

7. Go to your repository on GitHub.

8. Click on the "Settings" tab.

9. Scroll to the "Code and automation > Pages" section.

10. Under "Source", select the branch you pushed your changes to (e.g., main).

11. Click on "Save" or "Update".

12. GitHub Pages will now build and deploy your project. Once the deployment is complete, you will see a green success message with the URL of your deployed assignment.

13. Access your hosted assignment by visiting the provided URL. Please note that it may take a few minutes for your changes to propagate and for the site to be accessible.

**Note**: Ensure that your project includes an index.html file at the root of the repository or in the specified deployment folder. This will serve as the entry point for your GitHub Pages site.
