This is the repo created to contain all the js programs from JONAS course.

use video no 25 to revise logical operators (and, not, or);

video 37 to revise functions

video 80 to add and remove classes.


105: Learned about the spread operator, how to unpack arrays and iterables. Also spread operator works on objects also just like arrays. Unpacking and all that stuff can be done using ...

106: Rest it works contradicting the spread operator, rest actually builds up arrays (gathers them or joins them) and objects. (iterables).

107: On short circuting the OR (||) operator it returns the first truthy value found, whereas the AND (&&) operator returns the first falsy value found.

108:Nullish operator treats 0 and '' (empty string as truthy values.)

109: Coding Challenge #1

110 : Use for of loop to iterate through each element of our restaurant object and print a string to the user.

111: used enhanced lietrals for object creation.

112: Nullish and optional chaining works very well together. Optional chaining can be used to see if the obj or element is empty (refer to array example user)

113: We can loop object using their property names and Object.keys(), Object.values() to loop through. Also then further we can use for(const var_name of obj_name) to loop further and retrieve data from a object.

114: Coding challenge #2

115: Set is a collection of unique data. We cant use set to retrieve data, only to check unique data from a source like array or object.

116 : Maps works in a similar way to sets. (collection of key value pairs ) (A map is iterated by using key property/value)

117 : Sinces map are part of iterables we can also loop them.

118 : Which data structure to use based on requirement, for simple list like information which we want to modify later we have to use arrays for unique items also to remove them later we have to use sets.

Maps and objects are used when we are getting data from a api which we are going to use further in the application

119 : Challenge #3

120-123: String methods indexOf(),lastIndexOf(),slice(),split(),join(),tolowercase(),touppercase(),replace(),trim(),repeat(),startsWith(),endsWith(),padStart(),padEnd()

126: setting default parameters in functions

127: Value vs reference arguments in functions, works (similar to c program of swapping two nos.)
Learned call by value and by refrence using a imaginery passport concept. JS does not have call/passing by reference. Only call/pass by value.

128: Simple functions are known as first class functions and the function which receives another function as argument are known as higher order functions.

129 : Learned about call back functions, and using different functions all together in one big function. Higher order function in practice. 

130 : Functions returning function, used a function like greet to return another function.

131 : Used this keyword and manually set it to something else using call() and apply() methods on a function.

132 : Bind method, used to manually set the this keywords but it creates a new function

133 : Challenge #1

started from 153
154 : The find method of arrays

162 : The best video to revise array methods, which one to use when.

23 array methods in js
