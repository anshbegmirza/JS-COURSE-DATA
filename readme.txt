This is the repo created to contain all the js programs from JONAS course.

use video no 25 to revise logical operators (and, not, or);

video 37 to revise functions

video 80 to add and remove classes.


105: Learned about the spread operator, how to unpack arrays and iterables. Also spread operator works on objects also just like arrays. Unpacking and all that stuff can be done using ...

106: Rest it works contradicting the spread operator, rest actually builds up arrays (gathers them or joins them) and objects. (iterables).

107: On short circuting the OR (||) operator it returns the first truthy value found, whereas the AND (&&) operator returns the first falsy value found.

108:Nullish operator treats 0 and '' (empty string as truthy values.)

109: Coding Challenge #1

110 : Use for of loop to iterate through each element of our restaurant object and print a string to the user.

111: used enhanced lietrals for object creation.

112: Nullish and optional chaining works very well together. Optional chaining can be used to see if the obj or element is empty (refer to array example user)

113: We can loop object using their property names and Object.keys(), Object.values() to loop through. Also then further we can use for(const var_name of obj_name) to loop further and retrieve data from a object.

114: Coding challenge #2

115: Set is a collection of unique data. We cant use set to retrieve data, only to check unique data from a source like array or object.

116 : Maps works in a similar way to sets. (collection of key value pairs ) (A map is iterated by using key property/value)
